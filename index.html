          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>I am a recent graduate from Colorado College with a Bachelor of Liberal Arts with a major in Computer Science.
             Born and raised in Boston, I plan to remain on the East Coast after living in Colorado Springs, CO for the past four years.
            At Colorado College, I was an active participant in the Computer Science department, 
            and my work is listed in the Resume page, as well as a more detailed description of my undergraduate research under the Research page.
        Additionally, I have created a number of mini-game projects under the Portfolio tab. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or comments in the below form, or in the Contact page.  </p>
