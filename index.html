            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p> You can call me Liz. I am a recent graduate from Colorado College with a Bachelor of Liberal Arts with a 
                major in Computer Science. I am born and raised in Boston, MA and plan to remain on the East Coast after returning from Colorado Springs, CO. 
                 This website serves as a way to get to know me and some of my work. My main interest
                areas are in usability and user interaction, front end design and visual expression. There are a 
                number of games and sample applications under the Projects tab which I created the visuals and code for. My resume and a more detailed
                description of my research done while at Colorado College is included under the Resume and Research tabs respectively. If you have any questions, or want to reach out, please refer to my Contact
                tab below or in the form below.
