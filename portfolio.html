        <p>
          In the Spring of 2023 I developed a minial front end web application inspired by Health tracking applications
          and journaling in order to encourage healthy self-reflection. This project took approximately one month, including planning and development. In the site you can log different events, similar to a Diary 
          for specific time periods such as a gym workout, meeting at work, or team project, and leave information attatched to that event such as the individuals 
          you were with, the emotional rating of that event (how positively or negatively you experienced the event) and a description.

          This application was created with HTML, css, and JavaScript. All information is saved in local storage in the current web browser, but can be saved and shared to any device.
        There is also an option to generate test data in order to play around with the applciation without having to input information. Origionally hosted with Google Cloud, I have recently reuploaded with site to GitHub in order to host through Vercel. </p>
