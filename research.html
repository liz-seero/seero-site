          <h3>Abstract</h3>
          <p>Meetings are a frequent part of life for a software developer. 
            Software design is often performed, discussed, and reviewed in these meetings.
             This means that meetings may contain important design information that could be 
             captured for later use. Meeting design tools may be a way to capture design 
             information as a byproduct of discussion that arises in these meetings.
              In this paper, we identify a list of key meeting support tool features 
              that could support the capture and retrieval of design information and compare
             these to features currently offered in commercial meeting support tools.</p>

        <h3> Description</h3>

        <p>Meetings are a central component of software development, creating a need for effective support tools to aid participants.
          A common meeting type is the repeating, or cadence meeting, which is held on a regular basis and that may continue discussion of topics from earlier meetings.
           When an issue discussed in one meeting needs to be addressed again in the future, many issues can arise between the initial conversation and subsequent meetings. 
           Participants may fall out-of-date on key information regarding the issue, forget important details, underreport updates, and the team can end up with entirely different understandings of the issue,
            making them ill-prepared to address problems as a group in a timely and efficient manner. Even when meeting transcripts or detailed notes are taken during a meeting,
             the information may not be easily accessible to meeting participants during review because they can be oversaturated with irrelevant information,
              difficult to search through and hard to identify helpful sections.
          Information that meeting participants believe is important, and may want to reference later, is called an Important Design Bit (IDB).</p>

    <p>In the summer of 2022, I worked individually with Dr. Janet Burge as the project advisor, under consultation with  Dr. Andre van der Hoek and Adriana Meza Soria. Our partners at UC Irvine developed a prototype for the capture of IDBs during meetings called KnoCap (Knowledge Capture). As vital as information capture is information
      retrieval, and we began to explore how we could extend KnoCap to retrieve captured information in future meetings.
      To understand how KnoCap compared to other meeting productivity and information capture software, and to collect information on market trends to help create the initial requirements for a new tool, a competitive analysis report was created from commercial meeting products, note-taking software, and research projects. The competitive analysis can also be used to highlight features that set KnoCap apart from the current market tools and identify areas for improvement. Each entry for the 16 companies and projects included a list of tools, challenges, and successes regarding scope and usability, as well as visual references to describe the differences in the designs more clearly. After becoming familiar with the domain, we created a set of user stories, a method used to express the actions available to users in the final product during software development, without having to build them out to completion, and that may not have just one strict solution. The user stories encompass three time periods: pre-meeting preparation, during the meeting, and after the meeting, with subcategories detailing the variety of tasks employees would need to perform during that time. The user stories will serve as the initial software requirements for a new meeting support tool that will extend KnoCap so that it can manage both the capture and use of IDBs in software design meetings. Finally, a chart created from the user stories, the KnoCap prototype, and competitive analysis, was made to evaluate how well each user story was addressed by the tool. In order not to create misleading information, the chart used a scaling system for each user story from 0-3, with 0 being not present, and 3 meaning that it represents a direct solution. A ‘?’ filler value was used to compensate for the fact that the full list of tools for every company or project was not always available. Some of the user stories were written to explore a more general story, and so only the
      main user stories were chosen to be in the chart, decreasing the overall number from 48 to 26. As more tools were added to the competitive analysis over time, more user stories were added, and more information was filled into the chart. The chart, stories, and competitive analysis all help to inform each other, and can also function as standalone resources in the future

    <h3> Description</h3>

    <p>Partnered with the University of California Irvine and the Colorado College Computer Science Department to study how information flows during meetings. My team analyzed a series of software architecture team meetings, tracking when information was requested, missing, or disseminated during the meeting, to analyze trends in the discussion regarding the effects of missing information, and more.
      During the summer of 2021, my team began our study by tracking the flow of information in a series of design meetings, analyzing the tool usage, missing, and requested information, updates, new or recurring issues, and more. The summer culminated in an adjudication process between me and my partner, having to reach over 90% agreement over each of the 10 meetings, an amazing learning experience in teamwork and academic debate.

    <p>Meetings are a critical part of our work and academic life, both in person and remotely. This summer, our team, along with another research team at the University of California, Irvine, analyzed the videos and transcripts of 10 distributed design meetings from a major healthcare software development company. Our goal was to understand the issues that arise within such meetings that may inhibit efficiency of the team or the ability to produce quality product. We began by creating a coding taxonomy to classify and organize our data. Our two primary areas of interest were to understand the types and frequency of tool use, and to understand the role of information both present and missing from meetings. After analyzing our coded data, we found that when  designers were missing information  they went ahead and made decisions anyway 44.2% of the time. Moving ahead while missing critical information could result in decisions that could impact the quality of software. The goal of this research is to understand what happens in meetings and to use that information to support development of tools intended to aid designers
      in making better decisions by capturing and presenting critical information.</p>
